<body>The work was done mostly together on the design, bouncing ideas back and forth during this process.</body>
  
<h2>Instructions:</h2> 
<body>
  <p>Open two different terminals and run python3 bank.py in one and python3 atm.py in the other.</p>
  <p>The connection will be quickly made and there will be a prompt for which digital signature method is going to be used, enter 0 for DSA and 1 for RSA.</p>
  <p>Username and PIN number will be asked at this time (list of usernames and pins are in bank.py)</p>
    <p>Once verified and logged in, users are able to use one of five different choices:
      <br>
    <li > Check Balance </li>
    <li> Withdraw </li>
    <li> Deposit </li>
    <li> Check Activity </li>
    <li> Quit </li>
    <br /> Once the quit option is entered, the connection between the atm and bank will be stopped ending the program.
